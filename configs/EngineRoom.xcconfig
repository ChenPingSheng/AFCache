// uncomment the lines below to build against EngineRoom

// EngineRoom sources must be located beneath the AFCache sources

// already be built as "Debug" and/or "Release" as needed
// this is a bit complicated because I didn't want to mess up 
// AFCache with the dependency. 
// 
// A better approach could be to modify the "Build All" target
// in AFCache to: recognize EngineRoom availablity and to use xcodebuild
// to build EngineRoom with the correct configuration and then 
// AFCache itself defining these build settings on the commandline.
// This could also allow for including a (possibly unsatisfied)
// reference to EngineRoom as a subproject.

// If you come up with a better approach to conditionally build a framework 
// against another one: please let me know. Thanks.

// Current solution: these settings are overridden by the AFCacheOSX-EngineRoom target
// if EngineRoom is available in ../EngineRoom
